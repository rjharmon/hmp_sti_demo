This is a demonstration of joining a class through a has_many table that has
a polymorphic relationship to two different STI tables.  The target base 
classes are specified in the HMP definition, and the targeted subclasses 
are not specified.  

In this case, the HMP documentation claims you need to specify all the STI
subclasses.  I'm not seeing that be true.  All the specs pass flying colors,
so the docs are either wrong, misleading, or glossing over some very
important details.

help?
