This is a demonstration of joining a class through a has_many table that has
a polymorphic relationship.  The target base classes are specified, and the
targeted subclasses are not specified.  

In this case, the HMP documentation claims you need to specify all the STI
subclasses.  I'm not seeing that be true.  WTF?
